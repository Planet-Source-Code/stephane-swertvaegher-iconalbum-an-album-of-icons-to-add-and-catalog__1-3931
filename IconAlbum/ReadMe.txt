Extract the zip-file to C:\
All maps will be created by this zip-file.


IconAlbum is a photo-album in wich you can acces your icons.
All icons are stored in maps. Every map can contain 180
icons. If you have more than 180 icons for the same subject,
create another map, example: computer1, computer2.

Click on a map to see the icons.
Clicking on a icon can do 3 things:
1) Save as: (to the map of your choice, for example when you are
   writing a program)
2) Move   : (to another map in the IconAlbum)
3) Delete : (to kill that icon)

You have also 2 commands:
1) Make new directory: makes a new dir in the IconAlbum
2) Search for icons  : starts a new form where you can search your
   disk for new icons to add to the album.
   When you have found an icon you like, you can COPY it to the map
   -tempicons. This map will automatically be created if not present.

Included: source code, a few maps with icons, IconBook.exe.
