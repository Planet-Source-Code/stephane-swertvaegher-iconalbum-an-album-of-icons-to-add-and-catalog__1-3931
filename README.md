## IconAlbum \- An album of icons to add,and catalog


</div>

### Description

A MUST HAVE PROGRAM ! Very usefull.

The IconAlbum is a collection-book (album) where you can store all your icons and view them at the same time. You can add, delete, move, save icons, search

for icons, make directories to store them in. Very handy when you're looking for icons you want to use in a program, a toolbar, ...

Unzipped about 1Mb. The zip file is 278 kb. It was written in VB4, but it works with VB5 & 6 too. I use it all the time when I make toolbar-buttons.

Included: the IconAlbum.exe, some directories with icons (about 200), the full source-code (for VB4), and a ReadMe-file.

The file is best unzipped in C:\. The different maps are made by the zip-file itself, so you can start right away.
 
### More Info
